This is a simple webservice that allows users to view data from the U.S. Census
Bureau's 2014 Survey of Business Owners. The front end is built with React,
while the back end is built with Flask. Because only a small number of variables
in the data set have numerical values (the majority of variables are
categorical), the webservice currently only supports viewing some variables.
